## üß† Medical NLP Backend (FastAPI)

The `backend/` folder hosts a FastAPI service that wraps four lightweight, open-source medical NLP models. Each model runs in **inference** mode by default and exposes a dedicated REST endpoint for question answering or entity extraction.

### 1. Create & activate a Python environment

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you prefer not to manage a virtual environment, install the essential dependencies directly:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn transformers torch
```

### 2. Configure model modes and handles

Set the following environment variables to enforce live inference. They already default to `inference`, but declaring them explicitly helps during demonstrations or reviews.

```bash
export MEDALPACA_MODE=inference
export BIOGPT_MODE=inference
export LONGFORMER_MODE=inference
export PUBMEDBERT_MODE=inference

# Optional overrides
# Lightweight checkpoints only ‚Äî the backend now rejects any override that references
# 13B+ (or otherwise unapproved) artifacts. The values below are the only supported
# repositories unless you extend `ALLOWED_MODEL_REPOS` in `backend/config.py`.
export MEDALPACA_MODEL_NAME="medalpaca/medalpaca-7b"
export BIOGPT_MODEL_NAME="microsoft/biogpt"
export LONGFORMER_MODEL_NAME="yikuan8/Clinical-Longformer"
export PUBMEDBERT_MODEL_NAME="microsoft/BiomedNLP-PubMedBERT-base-uncased-abstract-fulltext"

# Optional shared cache folder to keep downloads out of your default Hugging Face dir
export MODEL_CACHE_DIR="/absolute/path/to/hf-cache"
```

The first request downloads the model weights from Hugging Face. Keep roughly 12 GB of free disk space and at least 16 GB of RAM available. On constrained CPUs you can set `*_LOCAL_ONLY=1` after the initial download or point `*_MODEL_NAME` to a quantised variant.

**Guardrails**: the FastAPI wrappers will raise `HTTP 503` if you attempt to set
`*_MODE=inference` but the required checkpoint is missing or oversized. Any
`*_MODEL_NAME` overriding the allowlisted repositories above will fail fast with a
clear error message so that 13B+ downloads never start.

### 3. Run the FastAPI server

```bash
uvicorn api.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Once the server boots it logs the resolved `MODEL_CACHE_DIR` (if provided) so you
can confirm the cache policy before triggering any downloads.

### 4. Smoke-test the endpoints

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/medalpaca \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are early signs of diabetes?"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/biogpt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Suggest a differential diagnosis for chronic cough."}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/clinical_longformer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Summarize key findings", "context": "Patient reports chest pain and dizziness..."}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/pubmedbert \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "The patient was started on metformin 500 mg for type 2 diabetes."}'
```

Each payload keeps the request small enough that even CPU-only inference completes
quickly. All four calls should return `mode: "inference"` in the response metadata;
if a model fails to hydrate you will instead see `HTTP 503` with the exact guardrail
message (for example, if the cache is missing or you pointed to an unsupported repo).

Each response echoes the question/text, returns an `answer`, and includes a model badge (name, key, mode) plus the full `structuredResponse` envelope. When inference is required but weights are missing, the API returns **HTTP 503** with the failure reason instead of silently falling back.

### REST endpoint summary

| Endpoint | Purpose | Payload | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/biogpt` | Medical Q/A (DistilGPT-2) | `{ question, max_length?, temperature? }` | Fast, lightweight general-purpose language model for medical Q&A. |

### Troubleshooting

- **RuntimeError / HTTP 503** ‚Äì Inference requested but weights unavailable. Check disk, Hugging Face access, or adjust `*_MODEL_NAME`.
- **CUDA OOM** ‚Äì Run on CPU (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""`) or select a quantised checkpoint.
- **Slow responses** ‚Äì Reduce `max_length`, switch to a distilled model, or increase hardware resources.
- **Download stalls** ‚Äì Enable `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1` for resumable downloads or prefetch weights.

## üß© Frontend integration & comparison view


The chat interface (`components/chat/chat-interface.tsx`) now:
- Only provides a model selector for DistilGPT-2 (lightweight mode).
- Routes each request through `app/api/chat/route.ts` to the `/api/biogpt` FastAPI endpoint.
- Displays an inference badge per assistant response.
## ‚ö° Model Setup Instructions

This project now uses the small, fast [DistilGPT-2](https://huggingface.co/distilgpt2) model for all medical Q&A endpoints. No large downloads or special hardware required.

**To pre-download the model weights:**

```
python -c "from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer; AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('distilgpt2'); AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('distilgpt2')"
```

Or simply start the backend and the model will be downloaded automatically on first use.

**No additional configuration is needed.**

Set `DIAGNOSAI_BACKEND_URL` in `.env.local` if the FastAPI server is hosted elsewhere. To compare all models for a single prompt, pick **‚ÄúEnsemble (All Models)‚Äù** in the dropdown; the UI highlights which models produced genuine inference results.

## üìö Recommended workflow

1. Launch the FastAPI backend in inference mode.
2. Start the Next.js frontend with `pnpm dev`.
3. Ask health-related questions via the chat UI or call the REST endpoints directly.
4. Capture responses and metadata (model badge + mode) for demonstrations or grading reviews.

## üß™ MedAlpaca-style fine-tuning (synthetic diagnosis Q/A)

This repo includes a lightweight, no-external-API pipeline to generate a synthetic dataset of 1,000+ diagnosis Q/A pairs and fine-tune a causal LM with Hugging Face Transformers Trainer. By default it uses `distilgpt2` to run on CPU; you can point to a MedAlpaca checkpoint on a GPU box.

### 1) Generate dataset (JSON/JSONL/CSV)

```bash
python backend/scripts/generate_qna_dataset.py
# writes backend/data/med_qna.{jsonl,json,csv}
```

Each record:

```json
{"question": "Describe your medical question here.", "answer": "Provide a correct, clear, and concise diagnosis or guidance here."}
```

### 2) Fine-tune with Transformers Trainer (causal LM)

CPU-friendly default:

```bash
# Optional knobs
export BASE_MODEL=distilgpt2
export EPOCHS=1 BATCH_SIZE=2 EVAL_BATCH_SIZE=2 MAX_LENGTH=256 LR=5e-5

python backend/scripts/train_medalpaca.py
# saves to ./medalpaca-custom-diagnosis
```

Train real MedAlpaca (requires strong GPU, VRAM > 14GB typically):

```bash
export BASE_MODEL=medalpaca/medalpaca-7b
python backend/scripts/train_medalpaca.py
```

### 3) Test the fine-tuned model

```bash
python backend/scripts/test_medalpaca.py
```

This prints answers for representative questions to confirm improved, context-aware responses.
